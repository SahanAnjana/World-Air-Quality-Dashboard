# World Air Quality Dashboard

Description:

The World Air Quality Dashboard is a Shiny web application designed to visualize and analyze air quality data from various locations worldwide. This dashboard allows users to explore air pollution levels across different countries, view pollutant distribution histograms, and examine pollutant trends over time through interactive time series plots. It utilizes data sourced from the "world_air_quality.csv" dataset, providing insights into air quality metrics such as particulate matter (PM), nitrogen dioxide (NO2), sulfur dioxide (SO2), carbon monoxide (CO), ozone (O3), and volatile organic compounds (VOCs).

Features:

Interactive map visualization of air quality data across different countries. <br/>
Dynamic selection of countries and pollutants to explore specific data subsets. <br/>
Histogram plots showcasing the distribution of pollutant values. <br/>
Time series plots illustrating pollutant trends over time. <br/>
Seamless integration with leaflet, ggplot2, and other R packages for data visualization. <br/>
